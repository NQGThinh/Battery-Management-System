In this project, a BMS with monitor the battery abilities and report operational status to external device abilities was built using STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill. Main board will continuously receive analog signals from voltage sensor, current sensor to calculate SOC value, SOH value. Then it will send these value to Arduino board and show on mobile application.
